/**
 * Deferred shading is a technique where a 3D scene's geometry data is rendered
 * into screen space and shading is deferred until a second pass when lights are
 * drawn.
 * <p>
 * This scene is rendered into a frame buffer with multiple attachments
 * (G-buffer). Uniform buffer objects are used to store a database of material
 * and light data on the GPU; reducing drawing overhead. Shadow casters are
 * rendered into a shadow map FBO. The buffers are read while drawing light
 * volumes into the light buffer (L-buffer) to create the shaded scene. Then
 * shadows are subtracted from the image.
 * <p>
 * An ambient occlusion (AO) pass provides extra shading detail. Volumetric
 * light scattering broadcasts rays from our primary light. Lights are
 * accumulated to leave subtle trails, then bloomed to appear that they are
 * glowing. We follow these with some post-processing passes, including depth of
 * field to mimic camera focus, color tweaks, and anti-aliasing.
