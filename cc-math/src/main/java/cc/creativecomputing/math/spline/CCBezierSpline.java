/**
 * <p>
 * In the mathematical field of numerical analysis and in computer graphics, a 
 * Bezier spline is a spline curve where each polynomial of the spline is in Bezier form.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In other words, a Bezier spline is simply a series of Bezier curves joined end to end 
 * where the last point of one curve coincides with the starting point of the next curve. 
 * Usually cubic Bezier curves are used, and additional control points (called handles) 
 * are added to define the shape of each curve.
