/**
 * A Chebyshev filter is an IIR filter that uses a particular method to
 * calculate the coefficients of the filter. It is defined by whether it is a
 * low pass filter or a high pass filter and the number of poles it has. You
 * needn't worry about what a pole is, exactly, just know that more poles
 * usually makes for a better filter. An additional limitation is that the
 * number of poles must be even. See {@link #poles(int)} for more information
 * about poles. Another characteristic of Chebyshev filters is how much "ripple"
 * they allow in the pass band. The pass band is the range of frequencies that
 * the filter lets through. The "ripple" in the pass band can be seen as wavy
 * line in the frequency response of the filter. Lots of ripple is bad, but more
 * ripple gives a faster rolloff from the pass band to the stop band (the range
 * of frequencies blocked by the filter). Faster rolloff is good because it
 * means the cutoff is sharper. Ripple is expressed as a percentage, such as
 * 0.5% ripple.
